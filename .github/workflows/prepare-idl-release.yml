          Some changes were detected in the IDL since last time the `@webref/idl` package was released. Please review the IDL changes below.

          If the IDL changes look good, a new version of the `@webref/idl` package should be released. This pull request bumps the patch part of the version number in `packages/idl/package.json`.

          Please make sure that the changes to be released do not warrant bumping the major or minor part of the version number.

          If all looks good (and if all goes well) merging this pull request will trigger the release of the package to npm.
