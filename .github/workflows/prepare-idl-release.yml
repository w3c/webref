name: "@webref/idl: Prepare release PR if needed"

on:
  # Runs on pushes to default branch on files of interest and after a crawl.
  # Notes:
  # - No trigger on changes to "packages/css/**" to avoid re-creating
  # pre-release PR before package has actually been released.
  # - Crawl pushes to default branch but that push won't trigger the workflow
  # (a workflow cannot be triggered by a push made by another workflow). Hence
  # the need to react on "workflow_run".
