An exception is made for UAs which do not support multiple ranges per selection, and they may include this element. If the element has descendants on which the used value of user-select is not none, these descendants must be included in a selection extending across the element. This specification makes no normative requirement about the behavior of the clipboard. however, UAs are encouraged to keep the visual selection consistent with what would get copied to the clipboard when copying. Copying text that does not appear to be selected, or vice versa, is highly confusing to users. Attempting to start a selection in an element where user-select is none, such as by clicking in it or starting a drag in it, must not cause a pre-existing selection to become unselected or to be affected in any way. As user-select is a UI convenience mechanism, not a copy protection mechanism, the UA may provide an alternative way for the user to explicitly select the text even when user-select is none.",
