# Curated Webref data

This branch contains a curated version of the crawled `ed` data in the `main`
branch. Curation means applying patches to the raw data and re-generating the
`idlparsed`, `idlnames` and `idlnamesparsed` folders. The latter two folders
only contain IDL names targeted at browsers.

The curated data is published on [GitHub Pages](https://w3c.github.io/webref/ed/).
Main entry points are the following JSON files:

- The curated data index: [`index.json`](https://w3c.github.io/webref/ed/index.json)
- The index of IDL names: [`idlnames.json`](https://w3c.github.io/webref/ed/idlnames.json)

The files link to further extracts in subfolders.

**Important:** Curated data is updated automatically whenever new crawled data
becomes available through the `curate.yml` job. Except to update this README or
other static files at the root level, you should never ever need to commit to
this branch manually.
