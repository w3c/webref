235 specifications were crawled in this report.


## Specifications that could not be rendered

Reffy could not fetch or render these specifications for some reason. This may happen when a network error occurred or when a specification uses an old version of ReSpec.

## Specifications that do not link to an Editor's Draft


=> 0 specification found


## Specifications without normative dependencies

- [WebXR Augmented Reality Module - Level 1](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr-ar-module/)

=> 1 specification found

Basically all specifications have normative dependencies on some other specification. Reffy could not find any normative dependencies for the specifications mentioned above, which seems strange.


## Specifications without WebIDL definitions


=> 0 specification found

Reffy was expecting to find CSS definitions in the specifications  listed here but could not extract any.


## Specifications with unexpected WebIDL definitions

- [CSS Animations Level 2](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-animations-2/)
- [CSS Fonts Module Level 3](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts/)
- [CSS Transitions Level 2](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transitions-2/)

=> 4 specifications found

Reffy was not expecting to find IDL content in the specifications listed here but it did. Note that Reffy cannot deal with specifications that define IDL content and exist at different levels: only one level is flagged as defining the IDL. Other levels will incorrectly appear in this list as a consequence.


## Specifications with unexpected CSS definitions

- [CSS Properties and Values API Level 1](https://drafts.css-houdini.org/css-properties-values-api-1/)

=> 1 specification found

Reffy was not expecting to find CSS definitions in the specifications listed here but it did.

=> 196 inconsistent references for links found in 97 specifications

Links in the body of a specification should be to the same document as that pointed to by the related reference in the References section. The specifications reported here use a different URL. For instance, they may use a link to the Editor's Draft but target the latest published version in the References section. There should be some consistency across the specification.
