## Specifications that do not link to an Editor's Draft


=> 0 specification found


## Specifications without normative dependencies

- [Cascading Style Sheets Level 2 Revision 2 (CSS 2.2) Specification](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css2/)
- [Input Events Level 2](https://w3c.github.io/input-events/)

Other levels will incorrectly appear in this list as a consequence.
