If that quantity cannot be determined (e.g. is itself specified as a <aspect-ratio>, or otherwise can’t be referenced), then it is assumed to be zero. Note: This value can expand gutters even when there is no free space left, causing overflow. Specifically, an align-content value of 1tr represents the amount of space (which may be zero) allocated between two adjacent alignment subjects (grid tracks / flex lines / column boxes) by the justify-content property. Unless a different <content-distribution> value is specified, space is distributed according to the same <content-distribution> rules as for justify-content. The behavior of <number> values for justify-content is analogous. Note: The space allocated by align-content: 1tr will be zero if justify-content does not allocate space between adjacent alignment subjects: either due to not having a <content-distribution> value or due to there being fewer than two alignment subjects. If both align-content and justify-content have <number> values, then justify-content’s <number> value is ignored and its <content-distribution> value honored as if specified alone. fIf no <content-distribution> value was specified, then justify-content takes align-content’s <content-distribution> value (if one was specified) and otherwise falls back to space-between."
