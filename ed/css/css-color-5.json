This method must map the source white point to the destination white point. If black point compensation is in use, the source black point must also be mapped to the destination black point. Adaptation algorithms should be used to adjust for the change in white point. Relative relationships of colors inside both source and destination gamuts should be preserved.

This method produces the most accurate color matching of in-gamut colors, but will result in highlight clipping if the destination medium white point is lower than the source medium white point.

This re-optimization may result in colors within both the source and destination gamuts being changed, although perceptual transforms are supposed to maintain the basic artistic intent of the original in the reproduction. They will not attempt to correct errors in the source image. This method should maintain relative color values among the pixels as they are mapped to the target device gamut.

Use of this rendering intent is not recommended unless the specific source and destination profiles to be used have been checked to ensure the combination produces the desired result.
