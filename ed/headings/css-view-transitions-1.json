      "title": "Changes from 2024-03-28 Candidate Recommendation Draft Always flush the queue of update callbacks before capturing the old state. See issue 11922. Disallow match-element as a custom-ident. See Issue 10995. Add a non-normative note to explain that ::view-transition-image-pair() would typically not need custom styling. See issue 11926 Inherit more animation properties into pseudo-element tree. See Issue 11546. Use position: absolute instead of position: fixed on ::view-transition. See Issue 12116. Changes from 2023-05-30 Working Draft Use a keyframe to add plus-lighter blending during cross-fade. See issue 8924. Add mix-blend-mode to list of properties copied over to the ::view-transition-group. See issue 8962. Add text-orientation to list of properties copied over to the ::view-transition-group. See issue 8230. Refactor the old capture algorithm to properly set captured in a view transition before reading the value. Make the startViewTransition() parameter non-nullable. See issue 9460. Elements participating in a view transition are exposed to accessibility tree. See issue 9365. The view transition tree is not exposed to accessibility tree. See issue 9365. Animate back-drop filter similar to transform/size. See issue 9358. Copy color-scheme from DOM element to ::view-transition-group(). See issue 9276. Expose auto-skip view transition for a Document, to allow having outbound cross-document transitions preceed programmatic view transiitons. see issue 9512. Add a note about why view-transition-name should be animatable. view-transition-name: auto should be an invalid value. See issue 9639. Add note to explain paint order for entry animations. See issue 9672. Add note to explain how the named elements are cleaned up. See issue 9669. Refactor algorithm to clarify timing, especially of `updateCallbackDone. See issue 9762. Add animation-delay inherit to UA stylesheet rules for (::view-transition) -image-pair, -old, and -new. See issue 9817. Auto-skip animation when document is hidden. See issue 9543. Remove references to cross-document view-transitions, to keep the L1 spec clean. See Issue 9886. Export an algorithm to skip the active transition when the page is hidden. See issue 9543. Use snapshot containing block when capturing new state for document element. See issue #10177. Fix algorithm for dispatching updateDOMCallback promise. Scope view transition names to matching tree context. See issue 10145. Fix scoping to match name instead of element. See issue 10145. Add a rendering characteristics note about out-of-viewport elements. See issue 8282. Swap the order of invoking the update callback and setting the phase. See issue 10822. Changes from 2023-05-25 Working Draft Fix typo in ::view-transition-new user agent style sheet. See PR. Changes from 2022-11-24 Working Draft Pointer events resolve to the documentElement when rendering is suppressed. See issue 7797. Add rendering constraints to elements participating in a transition. See issue 8139 and issue 7882. Remove html specifics from UA stylesheet to support ViewTransitions on SVG Documents. Rename updateDOMCallback to ViewTransitionUpdateCallback. See issue 8144. Rename snapshot viewport to snapshot containing block. Skip the transition if viewport size changes. See issue 8045. Add support for :only-child. See issue 8057. Add concept of a tree of pseudo-elements under pseudo-element root. See issue 8113. When skipping a transition, the ViewTransitionUpdateCallback is called in own task rather than synchronously. See issue 7904 When capturing images, at least the in-viewport part of the image should be captured, downscale if needed. See issue 8561. Applying the ink overflow to the captured image is implementation defined, and doesn’t affect the image’s natural size. See issue 8597. Fragmented elements don’t participate in view transitions. See issue 8339. Rename \"snapshot root\" to \"snapshot containing block\", and make it an absolute positioning containing block and a fixed positioning containing block for its descendants. See issue 8505. Changes from 2022-10-25 Working Draft (FPWD) Add dynamic view transition style sheet concept for dynamically generated UA styles scoped to the current Document. Add snapshot viewport concept. See issue 7859. Clarify timing for resolving/rejecting promises when skipping the transition. See issue 7956. Elements under a content-visibility:auto element that skips its contents are ignored. See issue 7874. UA styles on the pseudo-DOM stay in sync with author DOM for any developer observable API. See issue 7812. Suppress rendering during updateCallback. See issue 7784. Changes in size/position of elements in the new Document generate new UA animation keyframes. See issue 7813. Scope keyframes to user agent stylesheets using -ua- prefix. See issue 7560. Update pseudo-element names to view-transition*. See issue 7960. Update selector syntax for pseudo-elements. See issue 7788. Add sections for security/privacy considerations."

Rename snapshot viewport to snapshot containing block. Skip the transition if viewport size changes. See issue 8045. Add support for :only-child. See issue 8057. Add concept of a tree of pseudo-elements under pseudo-element root. See issue 8113. When skipping a transition, the ViewTransitionUpdateCallback is called in own task rather than synchronously. See issue 7904 When capturing images, at least the in-viewport part of the image should be captured, downscale if needed. See issue 8561. Applying the ink overflow to the captured image is implementation defined, and doesn’t affect the image’s natural size. See issue 8597. Fragmented elements don’t participate in view transitions. See issue 8339. Rename \"snapshot root\" to \"snapshot containing block\", and make it an absolute positioning containing block and a fixed positioning containing block for its descendants. See issue 8505. Changes from 2022-10-25 Working Draft (FPWD) Add dynamic view transition style sheet concept for dynamically generated UA styles scoped to the current Document. Add snapshot viewport concept. See issue 7859. Clarify timing for resolving/rejecting promises when skipping the transition. See issue 7956. Elements under a content-visibility:auto element that skips its contents are ignored. See issue 7874. UA styles on the pseudo-DOM stay in sync with author DOM for any developer observable API. See issue 7812. Suppress rendering during updateCallback. See issue 7784. Changes in size/position of elements in the new Document generate new UA animation keyframes. See issue 7813. Scope keyframes to user agent stylesheets using -ua- prefix. See issue 7560. Update pseudo-element names to view-transition*. See issue 7960. Update selector syntax for pseudo-elements. See issue 7788. Add sections for security/privacy considerations."
