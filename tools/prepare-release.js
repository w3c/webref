/**
 * Prepare a Webref package release pull request if needed.
 *
 * The pull request contains the diff as description, and bumps the version
 * patch number of the corresponding `package.json` file.
 *
 * Pre-requisites:
 * - The local repo must be up-to-date with the remote repo on GitHub. That is
 * typically the case when this script runs as part of a GitHub job.
 * - The current branch in the local repo should be the main branch.
 * - The `prepare-curated.js` and `prepare-packages.js` utilities must have
 * been run to generate the relevant data in the `packages` folder.
 *
 * If the PR is merged, the "release-package.js" job should run and actually
 * release the package at the commit on which the pre-release PR was based.
 *
 * If the PR is closed, nothing should happen.
 *
 * If a PR created by this script is still open, the script (force) updates the
 * PR.
 *
 * Possible TODO improvements:
 * - Invalidate or re-request review when PR is updated?

📦 Latest released \`@webref/${type}\` package was **v${latestReleasedVersion}**. Merging this pull request will release **v${version}**. Make sure that the bump is the right one for the changes.

✍ If any change needs to be made before release, **do not add a commit** to this pull request. Changes should rather be handled in a separate pull request and pushed to the main branch. You may leave this pull request open in the meantime, or close it. The pre-release job will automatically update this pull request or create a new one once the updates have made their way to the main branch.

🛈 The actual change introduced by this pull request is a version bump in \`packages/${type}/package.json\`. You do not need to review that change. The bumped version is not the version that will be released when this pull request is merged, but rather the version that will be released next time.
